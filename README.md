# N60TestMode8
Project for modifying a Sony SLV-LF1 VCR so that its audio processor works in Test Mode 8. Forked from https://github.com/rivvit/N60TestMode8/wiki/Sony-VCR-Test-Mode-8-Mod. Special thanks to Rivvit for experimenting and documenting the results.

This should also work or can be adapted for other Sony VCRs such as the SLV-ED818/ED919

Please visit [the wiki](https://github.com/hlim29/N60TestMode8/wiki/Sony-VCR-Test-Mode-8-Mod) for step-by-step instructions on how to implement this.
