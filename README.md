# N60TestMode8
Project for modifying a Sony SLV-N60 VCR so that its audio processor works in Test Mode 8.

This should also work or can be adapted for other Sony VCRs such as the SLV-AX10/AX20/N50/N70/N80/LX4/LX5/LX6S/LX7S/LX8S/RMT-V266A/V266B/V292/V292A/V293/V294

Please visit [the wiki](https://github.com/rivvit/N60TestMode8/wiki/Sony-VCR-Test-Mode-8-Mod) for step-by-step instructions on how to implement this.
